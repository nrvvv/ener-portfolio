# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

## 🧠 About the Project

This website was made with the help of AI.

It was created to showcase my qualifications and past experiences in multiple fields, such as YouTube Shorts creation, translation, and coding throughout my high school and university years.

I decided to build this website as my first personal project to see what I am capable of doing without relying on a pre-made grid system or framework.

Designed entirely from scratch, the goal was to make it intuitive — just by scrolling, you can understand everything about me.

## 🏗️ Structure

This website is structured into 5 main parts:
	•	Home Page: Features an interactive starfield hover effect that creates a dynamic first impression and sets the visual tone for the site.
	•	YouTube Journey: A timeline-style section that explains my growth, milestones, and lessons from producing Shorts and running channels.
	•	Translation: A showcase of my localization work, languages I translate into, and notable projects/collaborations.
	•	Coding: Highlights my coding projects, university work, and links to my developer profiles.
	•	Contact: Easy ways to reach me — CV, LinkedIn, and an email link for commissions or collaborations.


## 📱 Responsiveness

The site is fully responsive: layouts, typography, and interactive elements adapt smoothly to different screen sizes so the experience stays polished on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Special care was taken for the mobile navigation and timeline so that content remains readable and visually balanced on smaller screens.
